Password Exploitation

This project was for my introduction to security class during my last semester.

The goal of the project was to use word dictionaries to try and find matches for a list of hashes.
The different python files read from some of the dictionaries that are written in a matching ,txt file.
Using these dictionaries, we put the strings into hashing algorithms to try and see if a match can be found.
