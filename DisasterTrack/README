Disaster Track

This project was a group project for my software engineering class during my last semester.
The goal of the project was to create an executable software for a "Disaster Relief Company".

The functionalities required for the software were:
-A call center page where the call center staff could enter data about a reported incident
-A mission assignment page where the Mission Responder chief could assign a reported mission to a responder/volunteer
-A mission view page where an employee could view his/her assigned missions
-Authentication so a logged in employee can ony access pages that he/she is authorized to access

We used the tKinter Python package for the front end GUI and AWS to host our remote MySQL Server.
