MIPS

This project was for my architecture class during my last semester at UMBC.

The goal of the project was to create a software representation of a MIPS instruction set architecture.
The mips.h file contains all of the functions that can perform the different instruction types.

The main.cpp loads the initial memory state and instructions using IMemory.txt and Instructions.txt,
and manipulates the 32-bit Memory in IMemory.txt using the provided instruction sets.
Once the instructions have been performed, the new state of memory will be outputted in
a Memory.txt file and Registers.txt file.
